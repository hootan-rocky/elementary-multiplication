Notice that all the exercises are made in different files and all are called in the main HTML file for
educational purpose (otherwise it was better for all to be made in the same file of js)

The pickExercise file contains a function that takes the number of the exercise from you
and runs the function related to it.

Note that the functions aren't called in their files and only the pickExercise file is made to call them.
